# vim-boxdraw - Draw ASCII diagrams in Vim

## Introduction

The vim-boxdraw plugin makes it easy to draw simple ASCII diagrams in
`blockwise-visual` mode. The basic idea is simple:

- Select a rectangle on the screen
- Invoke a draw command.

All commands are mapped to the `+` prefix. See the
[vim help file](doc/boxdraw.txt) for reference.
